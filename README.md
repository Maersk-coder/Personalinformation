# How to create a person in Java

The aim in these exercises where to create 3 classes. A person class, address class and a MyDate class. The goal here were to make a codetester to run all the classes together (call them into the tester)

Project structure
```bash
Lektion 9/
└── SRC/
    ├── Address.java
    ├── MyDate.java
    ├── Person.java   ← Calls Address and MyDate
    └── CodeTester.java
```

```bash
